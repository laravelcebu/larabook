# LaraBook

Taking facebook's functionality and creating it via Laravel. The items below are designed to get as realistic as things sould be but will also allow participants to understand how things work under the hood - a real grasp of the backend.

## Items

1. Basic Layout - newsfeed including search and navigation @dorelljames
2. Authentication - basic login/logout. forgot password with working email. @dorelljames
3. Newsfeed - create posts, update post and delete post. include ability to upload pictures/videos and show a list in newsfeed. @harlekoy
4. Profile & Timeline - create profile page, update user info, change password. also show posts of current user from #3. @ni√±o
5. Search - show search results in category tabs - 1. All | 2. Posts | 3. People @harlekoy

## Caveats 

1. Nothing too fancy with use of JavaScript to make things real simple and understandable.
